{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"missing lifetime specifier","code":{"code":"E0106","explanation":"This error indicates that a lifetime is missing from a type. If it is an error\ninside a function signature, the problem may be with failing to adhere to the\nlifetime elision rules (see below).\n\nErroneous code examples:\n\n```compile_fail,E0106\nstruct Foo1 { x: &bool }\n              // ^ expected lifetime parameter\nstruct Foo2<'a> { x: &'a bool } // correct\n\nstruct Bar1 { x: Foo2 }\n              // ^^^^ expected lifetime parameter\nstruct Bar2<'a> { x: Foo2<'a> } // correct\n\nenum Baz1 { A(u8), B(&bool), }\n                  // ^ expected lifetime parameter\nenum Baz2<'a> { A(u8), B(&'a bool), } // correct\n\ntype MyStr1 = &str;\n           // ^ expected lifetime parameter\ntype MyStr2<'a> = &'a str; // correct\n```\n\nLifetime elision is a special, limited kind of inference for lifetimes in\nfunction signatures which allows you to leave out lifetimes in certain cases.\nFor more background on lifetime elision see [the book][book-le].\n\nThe lifetime elision rules require that any function signature with an elided\noutput lifetime must either have:\n\n - exactly one input lifetime\n - or, multiple input lifetimes, but the function must also be a method with a\n   `&self` or `&mut self` receiver\n\nIn the first case, the output lifetime is inferred to be the same as the unique\ninput lifetime. In the second case, the lifetime is instead inferred to be the\nsame as the lifetime on `&self` or `&mut self`.\n\nHere are some examples of elision errors:\n\n```compile_fail,E0106\n// error, no input lifetimes\nfn foo() -> &str { }\n\n// error, `x` and `y` have distinct lifetimes inferred\nfn bar(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str { }\n\n// error, `y`'s lifetime is inferred to be distinct from `x`'s\nfn baz<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &str { }\n```\n\n[book-le]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#lifetime-elision\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":70,"byte_end":71,"line_start":4,"line_end":4,"column_start":16,"column_end":17,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"fn dangle() -> &String { //ERROR HERE","highlight_start":16,"highlight_end":17}],"label":"expected named lifetime parameter","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"consider using the `'static` lifetime, but this is uncommon unless you're returning a borrowed value from a `const` or a `static`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":71,"byte_end":71,"line_start":4,"line_end":4,"column_start":17,"column_end":17,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"fn dangle() -> &String { //ERROR HERE","highlight_start":17,"highlight_end":17}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"'static ","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"instead, you are more likely to want to return an owned value","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":70,"byte_end":71,"line_start":4,"line_end":4,"column_start":16,"column_end":17,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"fn dangle() -> &String { //ERROR HERE","highlight_start":16,"highlight_end":17}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0106]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: missing lifetime specifier\u001b[0m\n \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/main.rs:4:16\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m4\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m fn dangle() -> &String { //ERROR HERE\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mexpected named lifetime parameter\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1mhelp\u001b[0m: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: consider using the `'static` lifetime, but this is uncommon unless you're returning a borrowed value from a `const` or a `static`\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m4\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m| \u001b[0mfn dangle() -> &\u001b[92m'static \u001b[0mString { //ERROR HERE\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                 \u001b[92m+++++++\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: instead, you are more likely to want to return an owned value\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m4\u001b[0m \u001b[91m- \u001b[0mfn dangle() -> \u001b[91m&\u001b[0mString { //ERROR HERE\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m4\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0mfn dangle() -> String { //ERROR HERE\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\n"}
