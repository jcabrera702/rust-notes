// a is borrowed as immutable.\n    bar(a); // error: cannot borrow `*a` as mutable because `a` is also borrowed\n            //        as immutable\n    println!(\"{}\", y);\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this error, ensure that you don't have any other references to the\nvariable before trying to access it with a different mutability:\n\n```\nfn bar(x: &mut i32) {}\nfn foo(a: &mut i32) {\n    bar(a);\n    let y = &a; // ok!\n    println!(\"{}\", y);\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on Rust's ownership system, take a look at the\n[References & Borrowing][references-and-borrowing] section of the Book.\n\n[references-and-borrowing]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":100,"byte_end":106,"line_start":5,"line_end":5,"column_start":14,"column_end":20,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    let r2 = &mut s;
